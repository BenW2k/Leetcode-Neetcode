'''BFS

Commonly used when finding the shortest path 
exploring all nodes at a given level
Commonly implemented with Queue datastructure FIFO manner


DFS

Commonly used when checking if a path exists
Exploring all possible paths
Commonly implemented with a stack with a FILO approach

Preorder traversal - current node, left child, right child
- Used when making a copy of a tree
- Getting a prefix expression

Inorder traversal - left child, current node, right child
- Getting the nodes in a sorted order in a binary search tree (where the left is smaller and right is larger)
- For getting infix expression 

Postorder traversal - left child, right child, current node
- Used when deleting a tree
- Calculating postfix expression
- Calculating size of directories in file

Easy remember:
Pre - before children
In - inbetween children
Post - after children 

Binary search trees are sorted binary trees such that everything on the left of a node is smaller than it and everything right of a node is greater than it
Good at organising things and fast lookup times'''
